# Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to
# the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.
#
#
# How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?

#Answer = 40 choose 20 = 137846528820

#Need to go right/down 20 time each way. there's only 40 moves avaliable
#therefore from the 40 directions, you need to fill in 20 of the slots
#order doesn't matter
